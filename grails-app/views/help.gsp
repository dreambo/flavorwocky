       To start, try searching for an ingredient. If it's in the database, you will be rewarded with a visualization of ingredients that pair well with it.<br/>
       The flavor affinity for a pair of ingredients is represented by the length of the connector between them- the shorter the connector, the better their flavors go together! <br/>
      Ingredients are color coded- the color is a way of grouping ingredients from the same category together i.e. Vegetables or Fish

      <br/><br/>
       The Explore view lets you interactively explore pairings up to three levels deep. <br/> <br/>
       The Interactions view is a network visualization up to five levels deep. This visualization provides an insight into flavor trios that can form the basis for your next kitchen experiment- simply look for triangles in the network.
        <br/><br/>


        Go ahead and add a flavor pairing by clicking on Add Pairing, type in your ingredients, pick the categories they belong to, and specify how well they pair.
